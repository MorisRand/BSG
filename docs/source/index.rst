The BSG and NME Decay Libraries
===============================

The BSG library is a C++ program designed to calculate the allowed beta spectrum shape coming from nuclear beta decay to high precision. It couples to a smaller library, NME, which calculates nuclear matrix elements required for the higher order corrections to the spectrum shape. A graphical user interface is provided to automate parts of the procedure.
